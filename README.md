# Stock-Market-Prediction

Predicting stock market performance involves forecasting the future value of a specific stock, a particular sector, or the overall market. This service is highly sought after by companies looking to capitalize on their stock's trends for profit. However, it's a challenging task due to the stock market's sensitivity to various global factors, leading to its unpredictability and volatility. Investment banks play a crucial role in assisting companies, individuals, and governments in financial transactions.

In this project, the data given has been analyzed, formed visualizations, and  inferences drawn. The future trends modeled in stock prices using time series techniques. Model the best strategy for stock prices using classification techniques. Provided a comparative analysis of all the models implemented based on performance metrics and technical domain knowledge. 
Two variables are derived- 'Close' & 'Strategy'. 
The Close price is evaluated using Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). 
The Strategy will be evaluated using Accuracy.

*However, there is still slight fine-tuning which can be done inorder to receive a lower final score (wighted sum of 2 metrics) to improve overall prediction accuracy.*
